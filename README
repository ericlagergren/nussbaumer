The code in lib/newhope is taken from the New Hope source code, the rlwekex
from the "Post-quantum key exchange for the TLS protocol from the ring
learning with errors problem" paper implementation; see the accompanied paper.
Some of the sources in these directories are slightly modified to perform
bookkeeping to count the ring operations, or the files may only be copied
partially.

Use "make all-opcount" to only build the native, non-AVX2 implementation,
useful in case the assembler/compiler does not support the flags. To build only
the AVX2 version, run "make all-avx2".

Running "make all" builds both.
